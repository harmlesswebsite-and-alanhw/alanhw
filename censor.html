            <p><strong>Mickeysoft Windblows XP</strong> is a pretty detestable<note>Did you read 'detestable'? of course you did...</note> operating system.</p>
            <p>You can drag and drop! Oh!<note>Stay on topic please</note></p>
            <p>Seriously. Use GNU/Linux instead.<note>Or GNU on the Turd kernel, but that isn't stable yet.</note> You could even try getting the Turd kernel and making it so it is as nice as Linux<note>...but without all the blobs and useful firmware</note></p>
            <p>It also has many errors.<note><span style="color: red;">An error occurred while displaying this note.</span></note></p>

            <p>Anyways, you should be able to trigger errors by clicking the button above. You will get the errors like a native XP experience!<note>XP stood for Windows eXPerience, but meh, nobody cares. What an experience with so many errors!</note></p>
            <p>You can try censoring this text! Let's add a huge passage from <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>:</p>
            <pre>How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.</pre>
            <p>Nope, this one from <cite>Hamlet</cite> is even longer!</p>
            <pre>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.
</pre>
            <p>Remember that! Because, remember that thetestisreallyhard.<note>Did you read "The test is really hard" or "The testis really hard"? Ya of course you read "The test is really hard..."</note></p>
